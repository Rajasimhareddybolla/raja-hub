            <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Jensen often talks about how he worked as a dishwasher and a waiter. He didn't see it as beneath him; he saw it as training in humility and hard work. When NVIDIA was on the brink of bankruptcy in the 90s, he didn't panic. He focused on the architecture. He believed in the GPU when the world only cared about the CPU. Today, he powers the AI revolution.

                Linus didn't set out to change the world. He just wanted to build something that worked perfectly. He spent years in dark rooms, focusing only on the kernel. He created Linux, then he created Git because he wasn't satisfied with how things were done. He doesn't care about "polite" society; he cares about elegant, efficient code.

                Naval teaches us that code and media are the new forms of leverage. You can create wealth while you sleep if you build systems. But leverage requires specific knowledge—the kind you can't be trained for. You have to find your obsession. Your deep dives into ML and ADS are you building that specific knowledge right now.
