                The Emperor of Rome didn't have a "productive" day every day. He dealt with plagues, betrayals, and wars. Yet, he woke up every morning and told himself: "The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant." He didn't let their chaos break his peace. He focused only on what he could control—his own actions.

                Fired from the company he started. Publicly humiliated. He could have retired wealthy and bitter. Instead, he started NeXT and Pixar. He used the "lightness of being a beginner again" to fuel the most creative period of his life. He returned to Apple and changed the world. Your setbacks are just your setup for a greater comeback.

            <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Sam talks about how most people overestimate what they can do in a day but underestimate what they can do in a decade. Success comes from relentless, compounding effort. You don't need a perfect day; you need a consistent one. Every line of code, every ML concept, every DSA problem is an investment in your future self.
