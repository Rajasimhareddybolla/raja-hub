                When Karna was cursed, when his chariot wheel sank into the mud, and when his own teacher disowned him, he didn't beg for mercy. He fought. He knew the end was coming, but he looked Krishna in the eye and chose to be the greatest version of himself regardless of the outcome.

                Tesla was failing. SpaceX had three failed launches. Elon was down to his last millions, living on borrowed money. He didn't diversify to save himself; he doubled down. He put his last cent into the fourth launch. If it failed, everything was gone. It didn't.

                He wanted to be a fighter pilot. He came in 9th when only 8 were selected. He was devastated. He went to Rishikesh and met a Swami who told him: "Accept your destiny and go ahead with your life." He became the Missile Man instead. Sometimes, a "No" from the world is a "Yes" to a bigger purpose.
